# prueba-trabe
Here's my API REST focused on banking movements.

I've added a version header in the GetAccount method, to try the diferrent methods I've implemented that version 2.0 will return the balance duplicated.
I've added in the repository a .json of a Postman collection to try the API.

To run the project:
	- Run TrabeApplication
	- Use localhost:8080 to connect (for example: localhost:8080/api/account/A00001)
